3 Case study based on CNN using Keras deep learning.

## 1) IMDB
.Classifying movie reviews: a binary classification example

Two-class classification, or binary classification, may be the most widely applied kind of machine-learning problem. In this example, you’ll learn to classify movie reviews as positive or negative, based on the text content of the reviews.

## 2) The Boston Housing Price dataset
* You’ll attempt to predict the median price of homes in a given Boston suburb in the mid-1970s, given data points about the suburb at the time, such as the crime rate, the local property tax rate, and so on.
* It has relatively few data points: only 506, split between 404 training samples and 102 test samples. And each feature in the input data (for example, the crime rate) has a different scale.
* For instance, some values are proportions, which take values between 0 and 1; others take values between 1 and 12, others between 0 and 100, and so on.
